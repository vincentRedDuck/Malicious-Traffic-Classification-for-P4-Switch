# Malicious-Traffic-Classification-for-P4-Switch
## Project Description
The Internet of Things is a component of Industry 4.0 in today's society. In 2025, the Internet of Things will have a total installed base of sixteen billion and four hundred million [1]. This indicates that IoT technology is pervasive in daily life. If these devices are hacked, it will have a significant effect on the business or personal property. To secure their confidential information, the businesses employ the TLS encryption technology. Hackers also employ it to conceal the malicious payload. The state-of-the-art network security devices do not identify malicious traffic. Therefore, we implement an encrypted malicious traffic classification system in IoT encrypted environment.
